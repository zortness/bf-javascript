== Interpretations and Thoughts ==
Comparing these results to the last dataset, we can see that all of the browsers have improved greatly since December of 08, except for Opera, whose numbers remain identical.

The "alwayseval" mode is the original compiler mode from the previous versions of this project (pre-rev6). There is an obvious improvement with both the "preeval" and "dump" modes in the compiler, at least when it comes to running the same code over and over again in a loop, which, granted, is a very specific test case.

Although IE8 improved on its last set of numbers, it is still orders of magnitude slower than the other browsers in all cases.

Chrome and the latest beta version of Safari have a definite edge over the competition, but I wouldn't count out the Mozilla team.
