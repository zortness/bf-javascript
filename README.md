BF Javascript
=============
This is a set of experiments developed around a common simplistic
[esoteric programming language](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brainfuck).

The original intention of the experiments was to test the new JavaScript JITs 
that were being developed around 2009, such as 
[Mozilla's Spidermonkey](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpiderMonkey_%28software%29)
and [Google's V8](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/V8_(JavaScript_engine)). 
These tests were even able to identify some bugs in Spidermonkey during it's beta
phase.

The tests informed the direction of the JavaScript development of the company I 
was a part of at the time, as well as community members who used them, such as 
[ext-js](http://www.sencha.com/products/extjs/) and 
[coffeescript](http://coffeescript.org/).

As the JITs and hardware have improved dramatically since then, the execution
times of complicated JavaScript applications has plumetted, but it's important
to realize what operations incur more or repeated overhead over others.

I may eventually update these tests to run more complicated programs, but Hello World
is still pretty fun.
